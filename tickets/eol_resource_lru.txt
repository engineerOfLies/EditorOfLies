Resource manager should operate like a LRU pool.

Add a tag to the resource header that indicates the last time a resource was handed over to the manager.
When filling requests for NEW elements it should purge and hand over the oldest touched element slot.
When a file is requested, check unreferenced elements in case a slot can be saved from deletion.
