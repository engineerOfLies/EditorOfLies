Rework how lighting syncs to gl lights.

Since GL lights are limited, we should have the eolLights assign to the gl light
on a per-render-frame basis.  So if we only have the option for 8 GL lights, that
becomes a limit of how many lights can be active in one view.  Lights outside the
camera view need not be active.

This will be dependand on eol_camera_view_check.txt
