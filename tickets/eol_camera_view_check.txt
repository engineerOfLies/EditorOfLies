Add a function to camera to check if something is in view frame.

As an efficiency feature we should have a way to determine if an object is in
the camera view or not.  This way we can limit what needs to be rendered for:

- complex particles (meshes and sprites)
- actors
- lights - limited number of lights anyway, might as well make the most of them.
